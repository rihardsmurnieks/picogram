# Goal - Yesterday when I was at home I decided to start my project, so I spent about 2 and a half our to create layout and design of my website. The design I found in google, just did a search with keywords - single page application webpage examples, found one and recreated it.
#So today my goal was to create JavaScript functionality to my web page, so I did it by creating webpage that will help people to find apartments in Riga to rent. I wanted my webpage to has some kind of interface, so people can choose what kind of apartments they want. Checkboxes seemed as great option and it is. Then regarding their needs provide them with possible options to rent. Also I wanted to create at least simple pages with headings, so my menu would work and send to appropriate pages.
# I didn't know how to create checkboxes in react, so i found how to do that and copied code from react.tips/checkboxes-in-react, so created application.jsx and checkbox.jsx, and did these things:
# 1) read all instructions and understood how these codes work, so I can adapt it to my webpage and needs
# 2) In application.jsx I added 2 item arrays, and 2 buttons, so created 2 more checkbox fields, learned what is dynamic creation of something, in these cases checkbox fields.
# 3) in checkbox.jsx I found place where I can take checkbox value and use it, so after this I learned how to create if statements in render() part of react


#What didn't work out - I wanned to show results based on all three conditions, but made just for one condition - rooms.
